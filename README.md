Finding-Shortest-Path-in-Maze
The emphasis in this repository is on the shortest path problem (SPP), being one of the fundamental theoretic problems known in graph theory, and how the Dijkstra algorithm and A star algorithm can be used to solve it.

The basic goal of the algorithm is to determine the shortest path between a starting node or start, and the destination or finish.

Functions included while searching for the shortest path in a maze includes:

i)Create a new Maze.

ii)Reset source and destination.

iii)Search Path

iv)Erase all

Here's what more: i)Want to have a closer and slower look while finding a path u can also control the speed using slider.

ii)Can even change the dimension of the grid.

iii)Set the obstacles density you want before creating a new maze.

iv)Choose your own start and finish point.

v)Even can set a maze by yourself using wall.

vi)The above search for the shortest path using dijktra or A-star Algorithm.
